## General Tips

üîπ **Cleaning:**  
All recyclables should be free of food and liquid residues. This helps avoid unpleasant odors and ensures better recycling.

üîπ **Oversized items:**  
If you have large packaging or other items that do not fit in the bins, try dismantling them or tying them into compact bundles.

üîπ **Do not mix:**  
Remember, sorting must be precise. Do not mix materials in the same bin, even if space seems limited.

![Do not do this](images/recycling/not_ok.jpg)

If waste is left outside designated containers, the building management's cleaner may remove it for you.  
Leaving waste outside the bins automatically constitutes a cleaning service request.  
**Service cost ‚Äî 600 UAH**, which will be added to your monthly bill.

The same applies to violating waste sorting rules.  
A violation automatically constitutes a request for this service ‚Äî **600 UAH**.

Following these simple rules will help efficiently and compactly pack waste and contribute to better recycling.

## What happens to sorted waste?

‚û°Ô∏è Our janitors transfer the sorted waste to large contractor bins, which are placed separately to avoid obstructing passage around the building.

üöõ The contractor collects the waste and performs further detailed sorting.

‚ôªÔ∏è The waste is then sent for recycling.

## Is recyclable material actually processed, or is it just dumped in one container with everything else?

Recyclable materials sorted into green bins are collected by the specialized company **PP "Obukhivmiskvtorresursy"**, with whom the management company has a formal contract.

## Non-Sorted Waste

For unsorted household waste, five large underground containers are located at the corners between buildings **A07** and **A05**.

Unsorted solid household waste from underground containers is collected by **LLC "Profpererobka"**.

## Bulky Waste and Debris

According to the **Rules of Residence and Use of Common Property**:

> **Clause 8.38.** ... Bulky waste and debris, including construction waste, furniture, household appliances, and packaging materials, must be disposed of separately at the owner's/user's expense.  
> It is strictly prohibited to leave waste and debris in unauthorized locations.

This means that **construction waste must be disposed of by the property owner**.  
It **cannot** be thrown into underground containers or left nearby.

Here are some locations near **Unit.Home** where you can dispose of large cardboard boxes and other recyclable materials:
