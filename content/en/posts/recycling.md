# Waste Sorting

At **Unit.Home**, we sort waste ‚ôªÔ∏è.  
For your convenience, recycling bins are located on levels -1 and -2 of the parking area.

Here are some simple yet effective rules to make sorting rational and compact:

## Paper

‚úÖ **What to dispose of:**  
Newspapers, magazines, books, cardboard packaging, boxes, paper bags, office paper, cardboard.

‚ùå **What NOT to dispose of:**  
Dirty or wet paper, laminated bags, wax paper, paper contaminated with food waste.

‚úÖ **How to pack:**  
Stack paper in compact bundles or place boxes vertically to save space and prevent damage.

## Glass

‚úÖ **What to dispose of:**  
Bottles, jars, glass packaging from cosmetics and medicine, porcelain or ceramic items (preferably without lids and extra parts).

‚ùå **What NOT to dispose of:**  
Broken glass, mirrors, window glass, light bulbs, glass objects mixed with other materials (e.g., metal parts).

‚úÖ **How to pack:**  
Glass should be thoroughly cleaned of any food or liquid residues. For safety, place it in a box or bag to prevent breakage.

## Plastic

‚úÖ **What to dispose of:**  
Plastic bottles, containers, food packaging (yogurt cups, juice cartons), plastic bags, bottle caps, straws.

‚ùå **What NOT to dispose of:**  
Plastic items with metal parts or dirty packaging that is difficult to clean.

‚úÖ **How to pack:**  
Plastic bottles and containers should be compressed to save space. Bags should be folded or rolled up.

## General Tips

üîπ **Cleaning:**  
All recyclables should be free of food and liquid residues. This helps avoid unpleasant odors and ensures better recycling.

üîπ **Oversized items:**  
If you have large packaging or other items that do not fit in the bins, try dismantling them or tying them into compact bundles.

üîπ **Do not mix:**  
Remember, sorting must be precise. Do not mix materials in the same bin, even if space seems limited.

If waste is left outside designated containers, the building management's cleaner may remove it for you.  
Leaving waste outside the bins automatically constitutes a cleaning service request.  
**Service cost ‚Äî 600 UAH**, which will be added to your monthly bill.

The same applies to violating waste sorting rules.  
A violation automatically constitutes a request for this service ‚Äî **600 UAH**.

Following these simple rules will help efficiently and compactly pack waste and contribute to better recycling.

## What happens to sorted waste?

‚û°Ô∏è Our janitors transfer the sorted waste to large contractor bins, which are placed separately to avoid obstructing passage around the building.

üöõ The contractor collects the waste and performs further detailed sorting.

‚ôªÔ∏è The waste is then sent for recycling.

## Is recyclable material actually processed, or is it just dumped in one container with everything else?

Recyclable materials sorted into green bins are collected by the specialized company **PP "Obukhivmiskvtorresursy"**, with whom the management company has a formal contract.

# Non-Sorted Waste

For unsorted household waste, five large underground containers are located at the corners between buildings **A07** and **A05**.

Unsorted solid household waste from underground containers is collected by **LLC "Profpererobka"**.

## Bulky Waste and Debris

According to the **Rules of Residence and Use of Common Property**:

> **Clause 8.38.** ... Bulky waste and debris, including construction waste, furniture, household appliances, and packaging materials, must be disposed of separately at the owner's/user's expense.  
> It is strictly prohibited to leave waste and debris in unauthorized locations.

This means that **construction waste must be disposed of by the property owner**.  
It **cannot** be thrown into underground containers or left nearby.
